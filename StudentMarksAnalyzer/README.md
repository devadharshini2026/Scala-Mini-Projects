# Student Marks Analyzer

## About
This is my **Student Marks Analyzer** project in Scala. I built it while learning **collections, maps, tuples, lists, and functional operations**.  

It allows you to:
- Add students and their marks  
- View all students and marks  
- Calculate average marks per student  
- Find the topper based on average marks  

---

## Concepts Covered
- Maps and Lists (`Map[String, List[Double]]`)  
- Tuples and functional operations (`foreach`, `map`)  
- Calculating sums and averages  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- CLI menu interaction
