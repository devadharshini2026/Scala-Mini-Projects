# Simple Logger System

## About
This is my **Simple Logger System** project in Scala. I built it to learn **file I/O, enums, and logging basics**, while creating a **practical logging utility**.  

It allows you to:
- Log messages at **INFO, WARNING, and ERROR** levels  
- Save logs to a file (`application.log`)  
- View all log messages from the file  
- Timestamped logs for easy tracking  

---

## Concepts Covered
- File I/O (`PrintWriter`, `FileWriter`)  
- Enumerations (`Enumeration`) for log levels  
- CLI interaction (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Timestamping using `java.time.LocalDateTime`
