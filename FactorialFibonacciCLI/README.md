# Factorial & Fibonacci CLI

## About
This is my **Factorial & Fibonacci CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **recursion, functions, and lists** in Scala.  

You can compute:
- Factorial of a number  
- Fibonacci sequence up to a given number  

---

## Concepts Covered
- Recursion (`factorial` function)  
- Lists and functional programming (`fibonacci` function)  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Conditional statements and pattern matching
