# Movie Ticket Booking CLI

## About
This is my **Movie Ticket Booking CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **collections, maps, and functional programming**.  

It allows you to:
- View available movies and seats  
- Book tickets for a selected movie

## Concepts Covered
- Maps to store movies and available seats (`Map[Int, (String, Int)]`)  
- Functional operations (`foreach`, `map`)  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Conditional checks for seat availability  
- CLI menu interaction
