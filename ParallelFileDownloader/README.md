# Parallel File Downloader

## About
This is my **Parallel File Downloader** project in Scala. I built it to learn **concurrency, futures, and file I/O**, while creating a **practical tool** to download multiple files simultaneously.  

It allows you to:
- Download multiple files from URLs in parallel  
- Save files to a chosen folder  
- Handle download errors gracefully

## Concepts Covered
- **Concurrency** using `Future`  
- **HTTP requests** using `requests-scala` library  
- **File I/O** (`FileOutputStream`)  
- **Error handling** with `try-catch`  
- **CLI interaction** (`readLine`)
