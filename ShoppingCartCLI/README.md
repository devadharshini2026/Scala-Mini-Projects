# Shopping Cart CLI

## About
This is my **Shopping Cart CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **collections, maps, functions, and CLI interaction**.  

It allows you to:
- View available products  
- Add products to your cart  
- View your cart and total price  
- Remove products from the cart  
- Checkout

## Concepts Covered
- Case classes (`Product`) for structured data  
- Maps to store cart and products (`Map[Int, Int]`)  
- Functions (`def`) for modularity  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- CLI menu interaction
