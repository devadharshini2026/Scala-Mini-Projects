# JSON Data Parser CLI

## About
This is my **JSON Data Parser CLI** project in Scala. I built it to learn **JSON parsing, case classes, and collections**, while creating a **practical tool to view and filter JSON data**.  

It allows you to:
- Load user data from a JSON file (`data.json`)  
- View all users  
- Search users by name  
- Filter users by age  

---

## Concepts Covered
- JSON parsing using **Circe** library (`io.circe`)  
- Case classes (`User`) for structured data  
- Collections (`List`, `filter`)  
- File I/O (`Source.fromFile`)  
- CLI interaction (`readLine`, `println`)
