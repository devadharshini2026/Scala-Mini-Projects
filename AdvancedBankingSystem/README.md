# Advanced Banking System

## About
This is my **Advanced Banking System** project in Scala. I built it to **extend a basic banking system** with features like **transaction history, persistent storage, and interest calculation**.  

It allows you to:
- Create Savings and Current accounts  
- Deposit and withdraw money  
- Display balance and transaction history  
- Add interest to savings accounts  
- Save and load account data from a file (`transactions.txt`)

## Concepts Covered
- Object-oriented programming (traits, classes, inheritance)  
- Polymorphism (`override`)  
- Collections (`List`, `Map`)  
- File I/O (`PrintWriter`, `Source`)  
- CLI menu interaction and user input  
- Functional updates and persistent state
