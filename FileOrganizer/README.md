# File Organizer (Scala)

## About
This is my **File Organizer** project in Scala.  
It automatically sorts files in a given folder into subfolders like **Images, Documents, Music, Videos, Archives, Others**.

---

## Features
- Organizes files by extension
- Supports common file types (jpg, png, pdf, mp3, mp4, zip, etc.)
- Creates subfolders automatically if they don’t exist
- Moves files safely with overwrite option

---

## Concepts Covered
- File I/O (`File`, `Files`, `Paths`)
- Maps (extension → category mapping)
- Functions (`organizeFiles`, `getFileExtension`)
- Pattern matching
- CLI input handling
