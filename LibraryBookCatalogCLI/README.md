# Library Book Catalog CLI

## About
This is my **Library Book Catalog CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **collections, case classes, and basic CLI interaction**.  

It allows you to:
- Add new books to the catalog  
- View all books  
- Search books by author  
- Search books by genre

## Concepts Covered
- Case classes (`Book`) for structured data  
- Maps to store books with unique IDs (`Map[Int, Book]`)  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Loops for CLI menu (`while`)  
- Filtering collections (`filter`)
