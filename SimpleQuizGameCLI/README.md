# Simple Quiz Game CLI

## About
This is my **Simple Quiz Game CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **collections, case classes, loops, and user input/output**.  

It allows you to:
- Answer multiple-choice questions  
- Get immediate feedback on each answer  
- View your final score at the end

## Concepts Covered
- Lists and case classes (`List[Question]`)  
- Loops (`for`) and enumeration (`zipWithIndex`)  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Basic CLI interaction
