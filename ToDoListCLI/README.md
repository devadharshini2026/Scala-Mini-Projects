# Simple To-Do List CLI

## About
This is my **Simple To-Do List CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **lists, tuples, functional programming, and basic CLI input/output**.  

It allows you to:
- Add tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Mark tasks as done  
- Delete tasks

## Concepts Covered
- Lists and tuples (`List[(Int, String, Boolean)]`)  
- Functional operations (`map`, `filterNot`)  
- Variables and state management (`var`)  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Basic CLI menu interaction
