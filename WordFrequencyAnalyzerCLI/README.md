# Word Frequency Analyzer CLI

## About
This is my **Word Frequency Analyzer CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **file I/O, collections, maps, and string processing**.  

It allows you to:
- Read a text file  
- Count the frequency of each word  
- Display words sorted by frequency

## Concepts Covered
- File I/O (`Source.fromFile`)  
- Collections and maps (`Map[String, Int]`)  
- String operations (`replaceAll`, `split`, `toLowerCase`)  
- Functional operations (`groupBy`, `mapValues`, `sortBy`)  
- CLI interaction (`readLine`, `println`)
