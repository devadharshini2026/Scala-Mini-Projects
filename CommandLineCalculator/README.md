# Command Line Calculator with History

## About
This is my **Command Line Calculator with History** project in Scala.  
I built it to practice **functions, pattern matching, file I/O, and CLI interaction**.  

It allows you to:
- Perform calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
- View past calculations saved in `history.txt`  
- Handle errors like invalid input and division by zero

## Concepts Covered
- Functions (`calculate`)  
- Pattern matching (`match` for operators)  
- File I/O (`PrintWriter`, `Source`)  
- CLI interaction (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Error handling (`try-catch`)
