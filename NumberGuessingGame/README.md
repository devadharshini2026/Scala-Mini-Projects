# Number Guessing Game

## About
This is my **Number Guessing Game** project in Scala. I built this while learning Scala basics like **loops, conditionals, input/output, and random number generation**.  

The game picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The program gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and counts the number of attempts.

## Concepts Covered
- Scala basics: `val`, `var`, `Int`
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditionals (`if-else`)
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)
- Random number generation (`scala.util.Random`)

## How to Run
