# Bank Account System

## About
This is my **Bank Account System** project in Scala. I built it while learning **object-oriented programming, traits, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.  

It allows you to:
- Create Savings and Current accounts  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Display account balance  

Savings accounts also allow adding interest, while Current accounts support an overdraft limit.

## Concepts Covered
- Classes, objects, and traits (`Account`, `SavingsAccount`, `CurrentAccount`)  
- Inheritance and polymorphism (`extends`, `override`)  
- Encapsulation with `var` and `val`  
- Maps to store accounts (`Map[Int, Account]`)  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- CLI menu interaction
