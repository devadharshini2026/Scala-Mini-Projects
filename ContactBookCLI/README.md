# Contact Book CLI

## About
This is my **Contact Book CLI** project in Scala. I built it while learning **collections, maps, functions, and file I/O**.  

It allows you to:
- Add contacts  
- View all contacts  
- Search for a contact by name  
- Delete a contact  
- Save contacts to a file (`contacts.txt`)  

---

## Concepts Covered
- Maps to store contacts (`Map[String, String]`)  
- Functions (`def`) for modularity  
- File I/O (`PrintWriter`, `Source.fromFile`)  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- CLI menu interaction
