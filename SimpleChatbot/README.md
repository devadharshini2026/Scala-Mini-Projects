# Simple Chatbot CLI

## About
This is my **Simple Chatbot CLI** project in Scala.  
Itâ€™s a fun little chatbot that responds to basic user inputs in the terminal.

---

## Features
- Responds to greetings (`hello`, `hi`)
- Replies to `how are you`
- Tells the current system `time` and `date`
- Ends conversation when you type `bye`
- Handles unknown input with a default response

---

## Concepts Covered
- Functions (`main`)
- Pattern Matching (`match` for user input)
- Loops (`while`)
- CLI interaction (`readLine`, `println`)
- String handling (`trim`, `toLowerCase`)
