# Mini Banking Dashboard (CLI)

## About
This is my **Mini Banking Dashboard** project in Scala.  
I built it to practice **OOP (classes, case class), maps, file I/O, and CLI menus**.  

It allows you to:
- Create accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Check balances
- View all accounts
- Save & view transaction history in `transactions.txt`

---

## Concepts Covered
- OOP (case class `Account`)
- Maps (storing accounts in memory)
- Functions (each banking operation)
- File I/O (`PrintWriter`, `Source` for transactions)
- CLI interaction (`readLine`)
- Error handling & validations
