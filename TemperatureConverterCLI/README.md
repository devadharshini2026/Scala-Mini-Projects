# Temperature Converter CLI

## About
This is my **Temperature Converter CLI** project in Scala. I built this while learning **functions, pattern matching, and user input/output**.  

It allows converting temperatures between **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin** with a simple CLI interface.

## Concepts Covered
- Functions (`def`) for conversion formulas  
- Pattern matching (`match-case`) for selecting conversion type  
- User input/output (`readLine`, `println`)  
- Basic arithmetic and operations in Scala
